      After looking up the definition of what it means for someone to have soft
      skills, I think that I am incompetent in this area. To have soft skills
      means to carry certain personal attributes that enable you to interact
      with others effectively. Out of all the work environments I have been
      placed in, I have to be able to accomplish this. I am not sure if it has
      something to do with the fact that I am antisocial. I am currently
      working on mastering soft skills and finding ways to interact with others
      harmoniously. On the other, when it comes to my ability to complete a
      task effectively I would like to say that I am very good in that area. I
      am able to complete any task that is placed in front of me.<br>
