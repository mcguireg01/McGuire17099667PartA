			<h3>
				About Me
			</h3>
			My name is Erica McGuire and I am originally from America. I was born in
			Georgia on June 28th of the year 1997. I have since relocated to New York
			City, New York. I am in my third year of college. Back at home I am a CIS
			major. Out of all the things that come with being a CIS major, I have a
			passion for coding and design. These passions often pose themselves as
			advantages due to the fact that no one really likes the programming aspect
			of CIS. Another reason is that most people in America that are a part of the
			CIS department are males. Often times their creative juices are not always
			flowing. When I graduate I would like to find a career that integrates the
			two: design and code. Being that I am already in my third year of CIS, I
			chose this course because I wanted to see first-hand what material is being
			taught to students in the U.K. I chose this course also because I wanted see
			if there was anything new I could learn and use to my advantage when I
			return to the states.
